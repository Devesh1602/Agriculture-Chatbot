# Agriculture Chatbot using NLTK

This repository contains code for an Agriculture Chatbot using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python.
The chatbot has been designed to assist individuals who are interested in learning more about agriculture. It provides information on a range of topics such as crop cultivation, fertilizers, irrigation methods, pest control, and livestock management.
The chatbot uses NLTK to process natural language queries from users and provides relevant responses. The chatbot's responses are based on a pre-defined set of rules and are not generated using machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques.
